        Though this may be a somewhat old anime movie, it does not cease to bring much emotional trauma upon watching it. 
        Compared to the newest movies, the unexpected events that have great consequences along the movie are very much the 
        epitome of a 'plot twist'.<br><br>

        One of the latest anime movies to come out during the 2020s, 'Ride Your Wave' has a unique way of portraying the 
        physical and mental aspects of grief. Our main protaganists is deemed crazy by others hit by a big loss
        and she is left navigating the life after the event alone. Or so everyone thought that.<br><br>

        This one possesses a unique animation style as those of the earlier anime movies but still holds modern aspects to
        it. The story being set between early 9th to 10th century Japan where a Bamboo Cutter falls upon the discovery of a
        tiny nymph who grows at a completely different rate compared to all the other village children. Soon she turns into
        a very beautiful and desirable woman and potential suitors approach, all willing to perform impossible tasks to prove 
        their undying love for her.<br><br>
